# Audio Files Placeholder

This directory will contain the actual MP3 files for the audio player.

For now, the audio player will use placeholder URLs that can be replaced with real audio files.

To add real audio files:
1. Place MP3 files in this directory
2. Update the URLs in src/data/audio.ts to point to the actual files
3. Ensure files are optimized for web (compressed, reasonable file sizes)

Example file structure:
- midnight-serenade.mp3
- urban-dreams.mp3
- digital-love.mp3
- eternal-flow.mp3
- neon-nights.mp3
- cosmic-journey.mp3
- heart-strings.mp3
- silent-echo.mp3
- unity.mp3
- symphony-of-life.mp3
- rhythm-of-the-world.mp3
- first-light.mp3
- new-beginning.mp3
- rising-star.mp3
